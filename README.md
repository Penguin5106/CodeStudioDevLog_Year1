# CodeStudioDevLog_Year1

# TODO: Delete this information when it is practiced enough to become useless
The purpose of this devlog is to form the assessment submission for my Code Studio module. It must be reflective rather than descriptive, and it will be marked according to this grading scale:

after looking at the reflective writing example it appears to follow this structure

1 research and methodology followed when approaching the task

2 problems that appeared (only major problems not i couldnt find the documentation), highlight where the research differs from reality

3 methodology of fixing the issue along with any data and research to support

4 what went well/wrong in both your original approach and how you fixed any issues

5 how would you handle this next time based on what you have learned

6 reference list
